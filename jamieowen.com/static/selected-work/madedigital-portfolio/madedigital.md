Madedigital is the site of designer Leigh Hibell, a friend of mine who I worked with at the design agency de-construct.

We worked together on his portfolio site, and created a minimal site with subtle animations focused around a central wheel navigation.  The site was quite popular back in the day.  Developed in Flash and Actionscript 3.
