    The Serpentine Galleries is one of Londonâ€™s contemporary galleries situated in Hyde Park attracting 1.2 million visitors per year. It has exhibited works from the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst. 
    With funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies, they contacted design agency AllOfUs to design and develop a new digital experience available to users of the galleries WiFi network and visible on digital screens throughout the gallery.
    We developed a mobile web-application featuring interactive Text, Image, Video and Audio content cards that were curatable for each exhibition. Content was edited and delivered with the Contentful headless CMS.
