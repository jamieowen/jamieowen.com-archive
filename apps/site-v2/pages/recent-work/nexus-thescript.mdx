Google Tiltbrush is Googleâ€™s Virtual Reality based painting tool on the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. It enables users to create artworks by painting in 3D space; giving them access to a variety of effects, colours, 3d models and both static and physics-driven brushes.

Nexus wanted to leverage this unique way of artistic expression on a number of web-based client projects. We used the Unity SDK and Python libraries to read brush size, pressure and point & orientation data from Tilt Brush and wrote a custom web-based renderer in WebGL and Three.js. Rendering code was heavily optimised for mobile device to provide WebVR capabilities. Various Node.js scripts were created to reduce mesh data with point simplification and compression techniques.
