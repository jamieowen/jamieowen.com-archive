Argos is a UK based catalogue retailer operating online and in-store order/pickup services. They invested heavily in revamping their old store processes for a more digital focused experience. They contacted Razorfish to design and develop a different approach to visualising and browsing their product catalogue both in-store and online.

We developed a mobile, tablet and desktop enabled WebGL / Canvas based interactive hexagonal grid displaying categories of products in a fun and playful way. A Gift Selector tool took a heuristics approach to product selection by allowing the user to select products that were relevant to ‘Him’ or ‘Her’. Once a number of products were selected, a number of search results appeared on the grid. We also added support for the Leap Motion controller as an additional form of interaction.
