The wonderful McDonald’s fast food chain recently had a 40th Anniversary. They contacted Razorfish to help them celebrate this by means of a poster creation tool, that let users record their McDonald’s memories over the years.

Razorfish involved Goodboy Digital for the technical output and together we created a mobile and desktop friendly WebGL / Pixi.js based engine for allowing users to enter their memory and watch as typography unravels as they type. We created a custom WebGL based grid with physics animations imported from Maya. And a custom in-browser Parts of Speech Analyser to perform correct poster line break formatting, animation and typography selection.
