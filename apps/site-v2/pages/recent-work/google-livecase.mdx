Google approached Rehabstudios to iterate and prototype a new generative design approach to phone case creation named Live Case.

Live Case provided a number of predefined design templates with configurable colour, style & filter attributes allowing users to augment their content stored on Google’s software services such as Google Photos or a favourite location from Google Maps.

We worked on a full production ready prototype, creating a WebGL & Three.js based engine for visualising and configuration of design templates and UI built with Angular JS. Areas of focus included advanced blending modes of layers, print export, generative colour palettes, facial recognition and algorithms to find ‘best-fit’ photos to ‘fill’ photo regions of design templates based on photo size, template region size and number of faces found in a photo, for example.
