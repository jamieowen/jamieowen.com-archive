The National Museum of Qatar is a new museum located in Doha, Qatar. An impressive building, featuring exhibitions around culture, archaeology, trade, economics and modern day life in Qatar today.

AllOfUs were contacted to create a series of 30+ touch screen installations around different themes within the museum. We created a normalised CMS model within Contentful to cater for all exhibits.  
The user interface was built with React, with a configurable Electron wrapper allowing each exhibition to run offline without internet connection.
