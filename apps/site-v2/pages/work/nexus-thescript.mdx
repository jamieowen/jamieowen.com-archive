The Script are a popular Irish rock band who along with Sony wanted to create a digital experience for their new album launch.

They came to Nexus Studios, where we designed a mobile WebVR experience around Google Tilt Brush artworks positioned around a 3d globe, inviting users to enter the planets atmosphere and explore the artworks.

We wrote a custom webGL renderer, using the Unity SDK and Python libraries to extract brush size, pressure, and orientation from Tilt Brush data.
Custom node.js scripts were written to reduce mesh data with point simplification and compression algorithms.

Unfortunately the project was cancelled before all development could be completed.
