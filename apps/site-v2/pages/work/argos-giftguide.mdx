Argos is a UK based catalogue retailer. They contacted Razorfish to design a different approach to visualising and browsing their product catalogue both in-store and online.

We developed a digital interactive shopping experience. Featuring a hexagonal grid displaying categories of 1000's of products in a fun and playful way. A Gift Selector tool produced recommendations for ‘Him’ or ‘Her’ or 'This' or 'That'. Products were selected from a series of images which adjusted an underlying heuristic to narrow down their search. We also added support for the Leap Motion controller as an additional form of interaction.
