Lloyds Banking Group is one of the UK's largest financial insitutions operating in retail and corporate banking.

My role was within Systems Thinking/System Dynamics, 1 of 9 'design guilds' within Design at LBG, who incorporate design thinking and systems thinking to solve complex problems within the bank.

We worked in a multi-disciplinary team applying a double diamond approach to understand the problems faced by retail customers whilst managing their finances.
This involved looking at current ethnographic and behavioural science research to help define the problem space. Then mapping new and existing digital solutions to identify areas for further exploration.

From a technical point of view, this led into creating various digital prototypes for mobile and desktop, integrating system dynamics and agent-based modelling simulations into the process. ( via Python DLL/SO or WebAssembly )
