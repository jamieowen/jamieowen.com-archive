Google approached Rehabstudios to prototype a new generative design approach to phone case creation named Live Case. Live Case allowed users to purchase a custom phone case design generated using personal photos or a favourite location found on Google Maps.

We created a 3D visualiser and configurator to apply filters, color, and style to predefined design templates.

Areas of interest included advanced blending modes of layers, print export, generative colour palettes, facial recognition and algorithms to find ‘best-fit’ photos to ‘fill’ photo regions of design templates based on photo size, template region size and number of faces found in a photo, for example.
