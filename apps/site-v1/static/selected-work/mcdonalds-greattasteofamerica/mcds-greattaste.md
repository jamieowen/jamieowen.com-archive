Mcdonald’s worked with Razorfish on another marketing campaign for their Great Taste of America meals.  The campaign allowed users to interact with custom layered soundtracks of popular American music genres.

We developed a WebAudio and WebGL based desktop version featuring audio reactive visualisations that adjusted depending on sound layer selection.  And also a WebAudio mobile version that used accelerometer data to detect the ‘bpm’ of the users footsteps, to allow them to walk to adjust the tempo of the customised sound track.
