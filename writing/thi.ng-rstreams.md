# thi.ng's rstreams package

Some notes to begin getting my head around streams as per thi.ng implementation.

Karsten's code is beautifully succinct? Accept I am careful of using too much immediately as to isolate me into a way of working.  Perhaps some experimentation will make me a better developer. And to roll these functions into easier to use utilty functions - to hide this complexity.

I haven't got much experience with RxJS but this seems like a good standard. Thi.ng's version is also great as it allows combination of the trasnducer library as stream operators.

Thi.ngs main rstream package is :
**@thi.ng/rstream**

The documentation is really good - only just found it..
